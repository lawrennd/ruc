# Research Priorities

The research priorities are normally dictated by technical management, such as VP level, Director or CTO, depending on organisation size. In larger organisation, the research priorities are likely to be division specific, but may also be steered by some organisation-wide priorities. In smaller organisatons, these research priorities are likely to be organisation wide.

Research priorities will change and should be subject to constant review. However, the nature of ambitious research is that important ideas may take time (perhaps years) to come to fruition, so if research priorities are cycling too much, then it will undermine the applied researchers.

Having too many research priorities is an indicator that there is too little focus in research direction, and a lack of strategic thinking around the goals of a research organisation. Having too few research priorities is indicating that there is a lack of understanding of how research can improve projects. The optimal number will be dependent on the particular sector where research is being deployed.
